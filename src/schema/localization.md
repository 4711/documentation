Each administrative area in DatoCMS supports multiple locales, defined by the short ISO locale codes (ie. `en` or `de`). You can add or remove locales within the *Admin area > Site settings* section:

<div class="two">
  <div>![foo](/images/localization/1.png)</div>
  <div>![foo](/images/localization/2.png)</div>
</div>

Each Field is localized individually, so you can pick and choose which specific content needs to be translated and which not:

<div class="two">
  <div>![foo](/images/localization/3.png)</div>
  <div>![foo](/images/localization/4.png)</div>
</div>

As soon as a localized Field is present within a model, the form to edit its records will present one tab for each locale:

<div class="smaller">![foo](/images/localization/5.png)</div>
