### How integration works

DatoCMS offers an integration gem that makes it extremely convenient to transform the content stored in your DatoCMS administrative interface into local:

* Markdown files (complete with YAML frontmatter);
* Jekyll collection files;
* Jekyll data files.

With this gem installed, you specify how remote content needs to be mapped into local files using a Ruby config file called `dato.config.rb` you need to place at the root of your Jekyll project.
