### Overview

DatoCMS offers a JS-based CLI tool that makes it extremely convenient to access the content stored in your administrative area and:

* Write Hugo [posts](https://gohugo.io/content/organization/) and [content types](https://gohugo.io/content/types/) (complete with Yaml frontmatter);
* Write Yaml Hugo [data files](https://gohugo.io/extras/datafiles/);
* Add sections to your Hugo [./config.yaml file](https://gohugo.io/overview/configuration/).

You are in charge of specifying how DatoCMS records will be dumped into these files using a Javascript config file called `dato.config.js`.
