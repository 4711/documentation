### Overview

DatoCMS offers a Ruby-based CLI tool that makes it extremely convenient to transform the content stored in your DatoCMS administrative interface into local:

* Jekyll posts and collections (complete with YAML frontmatter);
* Jekyll data files.

You are in charge of specifing how records will be dumped into local files using a Ruby config file called `dato.config.rb`.
