### Hosting

We **do not host your static website**, we just offer the admin area: you are free to publish your website wherever you like. The nice thing is that there's plenty of options around, often totally free and super fast.

#### Integration with CI

You can connect to DatoCMS your favorite continuous deployment platform (Netlify, Travis, SemaphoreCI, CircleCI, Gitlab, etc.) so that everytime the content in you administrative area gets updated, a new build the website gets triggered.

#### The power of Imgix at your disposal

Every image/file you upload in DatoCMS is stored in Imgix, a super-fast CDN optimized for image delivery. By adding some parameters to your image URLs, you can enhance, resize and crop images, compress them and change format for better performance, create complex compositions, and extract useful metadata. For example, if you want to resize your image and convert it to JPG, just add `?w=800&h=600&fm=jpg` at the end of the URL. Take a look at all the available transformations!
